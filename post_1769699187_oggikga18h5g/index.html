        <p>Hey everyone,</p>
        
        <p>5 years in recruiting. Resume screening was slowly killing me.</p>
        
        <p>So I built a Chrome extension that uses AI to analyze resumes and score candidates automatically. It saves me about 70% of screening time.</p>
        
        <p>But here's the thing - I built it for MY pain. I want to build it for YOUR pain too.</p>
        
        <div class="box">
            <p><strong>What if we built this together?</strong></p>
            <p>Here's my offer:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>🎁 <strong>100% Free</strong> - No charge. Ever. Until you say it's worth paying for.</li>
                <li>🛠️ <strong>Custom Features</strong> - Tell me what you need, I'll build it for you.</li>
                <li>💬 <strong>Direct Access</strong> - DM me directly. No support tickets. Real conversations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Only requirement: give me honest feedback. That's it.</p>

        <p><strong>What I want to know:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>What's YOUR biggest pain point in resume screening?</li>
            <li>What feature would make you actually want to use this?</li>
            <li>What would make you NOT trust a tool like this?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Not here to sell. Just looking for people who want to co-build something useful.</p>
