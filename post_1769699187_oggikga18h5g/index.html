        <h2>📝 Version A (Recommended - More Emotional)</h2>
        
        <h3>Title:</h3>
        <p class="highlight">I built a tool to stop losing my mind over resume screening (built it because I was desperate)</p>
        
        <h3>Body:</h3>
        <p>Hey everyone,</p>
        
        <p>I've been working in recruiting for about 5 years now, and I have to say... resume screening has been slowly killing me.</p>
        
        <p>Every Monday, I stare at 200+ resumes. By Wednesday, my eyes are burning. By Friday, I've definitely missed at least one or two good candidates because I was just... tired. You know the feeling?</p>
        
        <p>I kept thinking - there has to be a better way. So I finally did something about it.</p>
        
        <h3>What I built:</h3>
        <p>A Chrome extension that uses AI to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Read and analyze resumes instantly</li>
            <li>Score candidates against job requirements</li>
            <li>Give me match percentages so I can prioritize</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>It saves me about 70-80% of screening time. I no longer dread Monday mornings (okay, I still don't love them, but it's better).</p>
        
        <h3>Why I'm posting here:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I want honest feedback from people who actually do this work</li>
            <li>Looking for beta testers who want to try it free for a month</li>
            <li>Not trying to sell you anything right now - genuinely want to know if this solves a real problem</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you're interested in testing, just drop your email on the page. I'll personally respond to everyone.</p>
        
        <h3>What I want to know:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Does this sound useful or am I just coping? 😅</li>
            <li>What features would actually make your life easier?</li>
            <li>What would make you NOT want to use something like this?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>No sales pitch, no catch. Just a fellow HR person looking to make this job a little less painful.</p>
        
        <p>Thanks for reading this far. Any thoughts appreciated!</p>

        <h2>📝 Version B (Shorter - More Humble)</h2>
        
        <h3>Title:</h3>
        <p class="highlight">Looking for honest feedback on a tool I built for resume screening</p>
        
        <h3>Body:</h3>
        <p>Hi all,</p>
        
        <p>Longtime reader, first time posting. I'm an HR recruiter (5 years in) and I built a small tool for myself because I was spending way too much time on resume screening.</p>
        
        <p>It's a Chrome extension that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Parses resumes automatically</li>
            <li>Scores candidates against job requirements</li>
            <li>Helps me prioritize who to look at first</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I built it because I was tired of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reading the same resume 3 times</li>
            <li>Missing good candidates when I was tired</li>
            <li>Spending hours on work that feels robotic</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Landing page:</strong> https://mrchen1225.github.io/linkedin-hr-helper/</p>
        
        <p>Not here to sell - genuinely looking for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Honest feedback on if this is actually useful</li>
            <li>Beta testers (free)</li>
            <li>Feature ideas</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>If this is helpful, great. If not, I'd rather know now.</p>
        
        <p>Thanks!</p>
