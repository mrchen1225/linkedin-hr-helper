    <h1>📋 Reddit Post - Focus on Problem, Not Product</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>🎯 Why This Works:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Focuses on the recruiter's pain, not your solution</li>
            <li>Asks for advice → people love giving advice</li>
            <li>No product pitch → won't get removed</li>
            <li>Encourages DMs naturally</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>📝 The Post (Post this version!)</h2>
        
        <h3>Title:</h3>
        <p class="highlight">Struggling with resume fatigue and screening volume—how do you stay efficient?</p>
        
        <h3>Body:</h3>
        <p>Hi everyone,</p>
        
        <p>Long-time recruiter here (5+ years). Lately, I've been feeling completely drained by the volume of resumes I need to screen.</p>
        
        <p>I find myself:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Re-reading the same简历 multiple times because I can't focus</li>
            <li>Spending way too much time on candidates who are clearly not qualified</li>
            <li>Missing good fits because I'm just... tired by Friday</li>
            <li>Doing a lot of "copy-paste" work that feels robotic</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>It's frustrating because I know there has to be a better way.</p>
        
        <p><strong>My questions to this community:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>How do YOU deal with resume fatigue? What keeps you going?</li>
            <li>Do you have any workflows or browser tools that actually help prioritize candidates?</li>
            <li>For those who've tried AI tools or parsing software—does it actually save time or just add complexity?</li>
            <li>What's your threshold for saying "this resume is worth a closer look"?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I'm genuinely curious what works for people who are doing this at scale. Always looking to improve my own process.</p>
        
        <p>Thanks in advance for any insights! 🙏</p>

            After posting, add a comment like:<br>
            <em>"PS: If anyone wants to try something new I'm working on to help with this, feel free to DM me. Still in early stages but would love feedback from real recruiters."</em>

        <h3>Comment 1 (If someone asks what tool you're building):</h3>
        <div class="box">
            <p>"Honestly, I got so frustrated that I built a small Chrome extension for myself. It uses AI to parse resumes and score candidates against my job requirements. Saves me about 70% of screening time.</p>
            
            <p>But I'm not trying to sell anything—I just want to know if it actually helps other people. If you're curious, DM me and I'll share what I'm working on. Free to try, no catch."</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Comment 2 (First comment to encourage engagement):</h3>
        <div class="box">
            <p>"Thanks for all the responses! This is exactly the conversation I needed. 

Really curious - for those who said they use AI tools, what specific features do you actually use? I find a lot of tools promise a lot but deliver little.

And yes, I'm working on something myself to solve MY specific pain points. Not ready for a full launch but if anyone wants to be a sounding board—or try something early—DM me. Always better to hear from people who actually do this work."</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Comment 3 (Soft DM invitation):</h3>
        <div class="box">
            <p>"One more thing—I've been building this tool mostly for myself, but I'd love to know if it solves real problems for other recruiters.

No website, no sales page yet. Just me and a Chrome extension.

If you're curious what I'm building, DM me. Happy to show you and hear what YOU need. Even if it's not useful to you, your feedback might make it better for someone else."</p>
