        <p class="highlight">hey guys, how do you not go crazy reading hundreds of resumes</p>
        
        <h3>Body:</h3>
        <p>hi all</p>
        
        <p>not sure if this is the right place but i need to vent and also ask for help lol</p>
        
        <p>i've been doing recruiting for about 5 years now and honestly? resume screening is slowly killing me.</p>
        
        <p>every monday i stare at 200+ resumes. by wednesday my eyes are burning. by friday i definitely missed at least one good candidate because i was just tired. you know that feeling?</p>
        
        <p>also i keep reading the same resume 3 times without realizing it. my brain is just... done.</p>
        
        <p>so my questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>how do you guys deal with this? any tricks?</li>
            <li>do you use any browser tools or extensions that actually help?</li>
            <li>is there a better way or am i just bad at this?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>thanks for reading. i feel better just typing this out lol</p>
